# Bar Manager (Back Office)

Bar Manager BO is a web-based application for bar inventory and operations management. It provides a back-office interface to manage products (inventory items like beverages and ingredients), suppliers, menu items (referred to as “sellables”), and orders, helping bar managers track stock levels and streamline inventory control. The system is built with Laravel (PHP framework) and offers features such as low-stock alerts, recipe management for drinks, and automatic stock deduction when drinks are sold. In essence, Bar Manager BO facilitates efficient bar management by combining inventory tracking with menu (recipe) management and order logging.

### Key Features

- **Product & Inventory Management:** Create and manage products representing inventory items (e.g. bottles, ingredients). For each product, the system tracks the available quantity in appropriate units (units, milliliters, or grams) and allows updating stock levels (adding or removing inventory) from the admin interface. Managers can set a stock alert threshold per product to receive warnings when stock is at or below that level. Low-stock products are highlighted on the dashboard so you can restock timely.
